# password-checker
Instance of zxcvbn for an interactive password checking tool. For a full explanation of what zxcvbn is, their documentation and to download the code for yourself, go to: [https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn)

I'm building an interactive online course, using Articulate Storyline and I want users to be able to check the strength of their passwords, using zxcvbn and interpret the feedback zxcvbn gives for them. 
Because everything about my own website is based on subscription (thanks capitalism!) I can't upload files to the host, so they will be hosted here.

Carry on, folks, nothing much to see here.
